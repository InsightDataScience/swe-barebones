# Introduction

This is a barebones framework to see how a repo with testing can be set up. 

# How to get it

git clone https://github.com/InsightDataScience/swe-barebones.git

pip3 install -r -U requirements.txt

# Run it

jupyter notebook unit_testing.ipynb

Run through the cells and make sure everything works (tough!)

# Run tests

From the top level directory, run:

py.test tests

# Go Develop

Please ask us if you have any questions about why things are set up the way they are, if it seems dumb, try to think about why it might be that way.
